\section{Research experiences}

\begin{eventlist}
  \listitem{2017.02 -- Present}
  {Automated PDE solver}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Optimized hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin discretization and improved its computation speed by around 50\%
  \item Implemented adaptive $hp$ refinement which significantly accelerates convergence
  \item Developed hybridizable discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin discretization, bench-marked its performance, and demonstrated its strong stability on solving complicated flow problems with flow features in different scales
  \end{itemize}
  
  \listitem{2017.04 -- Present}
  {Personal website \href{https://www.nioh.ca}{Nioh}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented responsive design, code splitting, and reduced dependence on external resources, leading to fast loading speed with average load time under 2 seconds on normal 4G network
    \item Designed and coded almost every UI component on the website with React and Redux 
    \item Experimented with modern web design features like progressive image loading and JavaScript features like \texttt{fetch}
    \item Developed a simple content management system for managing blog posts on Node.js
    \item 90\% test coverage with over 50 test suites and 400 unit tests
  \end{itemize}

  %   \listitem{2016.09 -- Present}
  % {Web server deployment}

  % Building and deployment of web server. Installation and testing of LAMP and MERN stack, ownCloud sync service, and Dnsmasq network infrastructure including local domain name resolution and DNS caching. Hosting and maintenance of development version of personal website Nioh.

  \listitem{2016.09 -- 2017.04}
  {Adaptive finite element solver}

  Development of an automated 1D PDE solver based on HDPG discretization in Python. Designed a complete solution procedure: a command line interface that establishes the problem and invokes the HDPG discretization, mesh adaptation based on dual-weighted residual, and solution and convergence visualization using \texttt{matplotlib}.

  \listitem{2016.01 -- 2016.05}
  {Flow over low Reynold number airfoil}
  
  Simulation and investigation of the flow separation, transition, and reattachment over SD7003 at 4 and 8 degrees angle of attack by solving RANS equations in ANSYS Fluent. Compared simulation results to experimental data and demonstrated the accuracy of the simulation technique.

  % \item{2015.08 -- 2016.01}
  % {Investigation of spurious artifacts}
  
  % Investigation of spurious artifacts in\cmd{} simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) and summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. Proposed and demonstrated that discontinuities at block interfaces potentially interfere the solution quantities and cause the unwanted artifacts.
